\page maven2 Apache Maven 2

<p><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a> is a build tool from the
Apache Software Foundation generally used for Java development.  It uses a 
Project Object Model defined in a <em>pom.xml</em> file to describe the build.
Maven 2 uses a lifecycle where at each phase of this lifecycle different goals
can be attached that are provided by plugins.  The JsUnit plugin is 
automatically attached to the test <em>test</em> phase.</p>

<p>The JsUnit plugin uses \ref rhino to perform the JavaScript tests.</p>

\section m2plugin Using the Maven 2 Plugin

<p>The JsUnit Maven plugin has simply to be declared in the <em>build</em>
section with the other plugins.  As usual with Maven 2 all necessary
dependencies are automatically available.  The plugin itself is published at
the Maven repository of BerliOS and in Maven's central repository also.</p>

======= TODO ========

The task itself has a <em>dir</em> attribute that defines the root directory
for all following file declarations.  A JsUnit task may contain multiple 
<em>source</em> and <em>testsuite</em> subtasks.  A JavaScript file to test is
declared with every source tag using the <em>file</em> attribute.  The reason
for an explicit declaration is a possible dependency between the files, that is 
resolved by loading them in the declared sequence.

The JavaScript test files are declared using the <em>testsuite</em> subtasks.
A TestSuite subtask supports following attributes:
<ul>
	<li><strong>name</strong>: The name of the test suite</li>
	<li><strong>todir</strong>: The target directory for the test results</li>
	<li><strong>type></strong>: The type of the test suite, one of the following values
		<dl>
 			<dt>ALLTESTS</dt>
 			<dd>Looks for a class AllTests derived from TestSuite and runs its suite.</dd>
 			<dt>TESTSUITES</dt>
 			<dd>Looks for all classes ending with TestSuite and that are derived from TestSuite and run their suites.</dd>
 			<dt>TESTCASES</dt>
 			<dd>Looks for all classes ending with TestCase and that are derived from TestCase and runs them (the default).</dd>
 		</dl>
	</li>
	<li><strong>characterSet</strong>: The optional character set for the encoding</li>
</ul>

\section m2example Example build.xml
 
The following JsUnit plugin declaration is used in the POM file of the samples directory.
 
\dontinclude pom.xml
\skip <plugin>
\until </plugin>
