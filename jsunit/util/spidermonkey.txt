\page spidermonkey SpiderMonkey

\section mozspidermonkey Mozilla.org's SpiderMonkey

<p>SpiderMoney is the name of the JavaScript engine from mozilla.org written
completely in C. Depending on the configuration, the engine is even capable of
compiling the JavaScript.  Since it is Open Source and especially designed for
usage in other products, you can find nowadays a lot of applications using
SpiderMonkey as easy scripting environment. Mozilla browser itself (and
therefore the Netscape browser also) is using this engine in their browsers.
This engine extremly fast and reliable.</p>

<p>Early version built into the iPlanet Web Server does not seem to have an
Error object.</p>

\subsection spidermonkeyexample Examples

<p>The SpiderMonkey sources contain also a shell that is able to execute
standalone JavaScript sources. You have to optain the sources from the CVS or
from a defined tarball and build the shell yourself. Depending on your OS you
will have an executable js or jsshell.</p>

<p>You can run the examples or the JsUnit's TestSuite giving AllTests.js as
argument running the shell.</p>

</ul>

\subsection spidermonkeydebugger Debugger

<p>The SpiderMonkey sources also reference two versions of a debugger, but I
did not get running one of them. If someone was more successful than me,
please send a note.</p>
