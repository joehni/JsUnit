\page iis Microsoft Internet Information Server

<p>Microsoft's web server is the Internet Information Server. It is part of
the Microsoft Windows Professional and Server versions and also with a
simpler user interface as Personal Web Server in the home user's Windows
versions. This web server is able to run Active Server Pages (ASP), that are
written in one of the languages registered in the Windows Script Engine. A
special article of Miscrosoft exists for debugging ASPs with the different
debuggers of the Windows Script Engine.</p>

\section genasp Generating JsUnit ASP

<p>Active Server Pages contain by default only HTML and client-side
JavaScript. Any script running directly on the server must be embedded into
the server-side script tags &lt;% and %&gt;.</p>
 
\dontinclude samples.asp
\until %>
\skip #include
\until Header

<p>To include the JsUnit library
files you have to run the <em>genasp</em> shell script. It will add these
tags to the beginning and end of the files and write them to the given target
directory preserving JsUnit's directory structure.</p>

\code
$ /usr/lib/jsunit> util/genasp conf/ASP
\endcode

<p>On Windows I personally use Cygwin to have a Unix shell environment.</p>

\section setupiis Seting up IIS for the examples

<p>To run the ASP samples of JsUnit you can start the Internet Information
Server (the Personal Web Server should also be capable) and add a virtual
folder names <em>JsUnit</em>. Set the root of your JsUnit location as root of
this virtual location. Allow the execution of scripts and add to the supported
default documents <em>index.asp</em>.</p>

<p>Run the web application and you should be able to run the examples of
JsUnit in ASP pages at the server-side:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a
    href="http://localhost/JsUnit/conf/ASP/">http://localhost/JsUnit/conf/ASP/</a></li>
</ul>
