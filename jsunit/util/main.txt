\section description Description

<p>JsUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests in JavaScript. It is
an instance of the xUnit architecture for <a
href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">unit testing frameworks</a>.
JsUnit is a port of <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> 3.8.1 originally 
written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck. It covers the core system and the 
examples.</p>

<p>For further information follow the links at <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestingFramework">Portland Pattern Repository for
Testing Frameworks</a> and the homepage of <a
href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.</p>

\section donations Donations

<p>While JsUnit is and will be freely available, the programming effort eats
up a lot of my spare time.  I really enjoy programming, but sometimes
maintaining and developing a framework becomes also a burden, since it
prevents me sometimes from investigating in new and other technologies.
Donations will keep my delight and motivation developing JsUnit at a much
higher level.</p>
