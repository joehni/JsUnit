\page products Product Overview

<p>This page will give an overview for some products of the product
compatibility table using JsUnit. The referenced pages explain the execution
of the samples for the specific product and give hints for development
environment.</p>

\subsection mozillaorgoverview Mozilla.org

<p>Mozilla.org provides two scripting engines, one implemented in C and one in
Java. The C version (SpiderMonkey) is used also in the Mozilla browser while
the Java version (Rhino) is often embedded in Java applications.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

\subsection windowsscriptoverview Microsoft Windows Script

<p>Microsoft's JavaScript implementation named JScript is part of the <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/">Windows Script</a> engine (also
coming with the Operating System). This engine is able to run a lot of
languages, JScript is just one among others.  Microsoft offers in the package
JScript and VBScript, other venders offer other languages that uses the
engine. Any application may use the scripting engine and process scripts in
any of the registered languages.</p>

<p>Please recognize, that the specific product versions using Windows Script
are delivered originally with a specific version of the engine, but they are
using the engine just as a system wide service. Upgrading this engine to a
newer version will also upgrade the languages delivered with Windows Script.
Therefore even and old Internet Explorer can use an up-to-date JScript
version.</p>

The JScript implementation up-to version 5.6 has an incompatible definition of
the Error class, they do not provide the Error#name and Error#message members.
Early versions also miss the Array#push and Array#pop member functions that
are in this case provided by JsUnit.

\subsection cscript Windows Script Host

The Windows Script host has two utilities running scripts from command-line:
cscript and wscript. Both utilities recognize the file extension and will run
JScript files directly. wscript will execute them in a GUI environment, while
cscript is a console application running the script in the console. JScript
code can be within normal .js files or the JScript files can be included using
a Windows Script Host (.wsf) file. JsUnit delivers a sample for both variants.

See description to \ref wsdebug for debugging. Alternativly you
can use \ref interdev.

\subsection iexplore Internet Explorer

The Internet Explorer's JScript capabilitites are inherited from the installed
\ref cscript. Therefore even an Internet Explorer 3.x may be able to run
JsUnit, if the engine was updated seperatly. The Internet Explorer adds DOM
objects to the JScript. The DOM is differrent between the various Internet
explorer versions.

Use the HTML include tag to add JsUnit to your scripts. See the delivered
examples. You might debug every script also using the \ref wsdebug or advanced
development tools from Microsoft.

\subsection wsdebug Windows Script Debugger

The Microsoft Script Debugger is also available at <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/733/msdncompositedoc.xml">MSDN
for download</a>. It can be used to debug scripts embedded in HTML documents
or for single JavaScript files. To debug a script from command-line use
the command-line interpreters with the /X option:

\htmlonly
<div class="fragment"><pre>
cscript /X <i>&lt;filename&gt;.js</i></pre>
</div>
\endhtmlonly

\subsection interdev Microsoft Visual InterDev

<a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vinterdev/technical/documentation.asp">Microsoft
Visual InterDev 6.0</a> is a development environment for web applications. It
is very comfortable with debugging client-side JavaScript code. JsUnit
contains a Visual InterDev solution (.sln) and project (.vup) file for the
unit tests and the samples.

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vinterdev/default.asp">Visual InterDev is
now integrated into Visual Studio .NET</a>.
