\section mozrhino Mozilla.org's Rhino

<p>Rhino is the name of the JavaScript engine from mozilla.org written
completely in Java. Depending on the configuration, the engine is even capable
of translating the code to Java and compile it automatically. Since it is Open
Source and especially designed for usage in other products, you can find
nowadays a lot of applications using Rhino as easy scripting environment.  The
engine is shipped in the file <i>js.jar</i>. A shell and a transpiler to
convert JavaScript into Java code is available.</p>

</ul>

<p>The version 1.5RC3 (and possibly earlier versions) has a bug and will throw
a TypeError if the method toString is called for a class derived from Error.
JsUnit is able to compensate this bug, although it is fixed for 1.5RC4.</p>

\subsection rhinoexample Examples

<p>The distribution of Rhino includes a shell, that can be used as command
line version to execute standalone JavaScript sources. This shell implements
some commands not available in the JavaScript standard. Concerning JsUnit this
is \c print to write to the console and \c load to load other JavaScript
files. Call the engine with</p>

\htmlonly
<div class="fragment"><pre>
java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main <i>&lt;filename&gt;.js</i></pre>
</div>
\endhtmlonly

<p>You can run the examples or the JsUnit's TestSuite giving AllTests.js as
argument running the shell.</p>

<p>Additionally the engine will also throw a TypeError running JsUnit if
optimization is enabled (greater 0). I have not investigated on this
further.</p>
