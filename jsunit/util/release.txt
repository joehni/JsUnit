\page release Release Notes

<P>2002-09-20: Current release is version 1.2.beta.1</P>

<P>A lot of internal work has already be done. Most changes of JUnit 3.8.1
have been integrated and JsUnit is running quite smoothly for JScript,
SpiderMonkey and Rhino. Also the new documentation script works fine.</P>

<P>Since the current state of the framework is now quite stable regading
the mensioned JavaScript engines I will release an intermediate version 1.2
before version 2.0, that was proposed to have an integration with Edward
Hieatt's browser GUI.</P>

	<TD>Update compatibility list</TD>
	
	<TD>Meanwhile I am aware of a lot more applications supporting JavaScript.
	Since most of the applications share the same JavaScript engine, I will
	introduce a grouping in the compatibility section of the documentation.
	Additionally I have to test the new JsUnit version for the supported
	platforms again and a compatibility check with the version 1.1 test cases
	should be done.</TD>

	<TD>Integrate with <A
	HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsunit/">JsUnit</A> of Edward
	Hieatt</TD>
	
	<TD>Edward's version of JsUnit is more based on a nice browser frontend.
	This would be also nice to have to my version. Edward and I agreed that I
	may try to integrate his GUI on top of my engine. Work in progress.</TD>
