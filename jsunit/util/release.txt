	<TD>Update compatibility list</TD>
	
	<TD>Meanwhile I am aware of a lot more applications supporting JavaScript.
	Since most of the applications share the same JavaScript engine, I will
	introduce a grouping in the compatibility section of the documentation.
	Additionally I have to test the new JsUnit version for the supported
	platforms again and a compatibility check with the version 1.1 test cases
	should be done.</TD>
	
</TR>
<TR>

	<TD>Integrate with <A
	HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsunit/">JsUnit</A> of Edward
	Hieatt</TD>
	
	<TD>Edward's version of JsUnit is more based on a nice browser frontend.
	This would be also nice to have to my version. Edward and I agreed that I
	may try to integrate his GUI on top of my engine. Work currently stopped
	for version 1.2. Will be continued for JsUnit 2.0.</TD>
