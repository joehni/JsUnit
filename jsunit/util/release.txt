<TR>
	<TD>Port current version 3.7 of JUnit</TD>
	<TD>JsUnit was designed very close to the JUnit structure. Despite some
	special Java constructs it could be done with not too much effort. It
	depends more on my available time.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>Use normal derivation mechanism of JavaScript</TD>
	<TD>My current approach supports multiple inheritance. I have to think
	about a new model supporting at least Java &quot;interfaces&quot; that
	is more conforming to JavaScript. Unfortunately this implies also a new 
	script for document generation.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>Integrate with 
	<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsunit/">JsUnit</A>
	of Edward Hieatt</TD>
	<TD>Edward's version of JsUnit is more based on a nice browser
	frontend. This would be also nice to have to my version. Edward
	and I agreed that I may try to integrate his GUI on top of my
	engine. Work in progress.</TD>
