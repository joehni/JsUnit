\page release Release Notes

<P>2002-06-25: Current release is version 2.0.alpha.3</P>

<P>While it seems not to be too much work to change the object model to
standard ECMA script, the real work was done writing the new Perl script
to support the documentation generation again.  This bullied me to learn
Perl (nice language) and the script is now quite smart detecting what you
have really defined.</P>

<TR>

	<TD>Update compatibility list</TD>
	
	<TD>Meanwhile I am aware of a lot more applications supporting JavaScript.
	Since most of the applications share the same JavaScript engine, I will
	introduce a grouping in the compatibility section of the documentation.
	Additionally I have to test the new JsUnit version for the supported
	platforms again and a compatibility check with the version 1.1 test cases
	should be done.</TD>
	
</TR>
<TR>

	<TD>Integrate with <A
	HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsunit/">JsUnit</A> of Edward
	Hieatt</TD>
	
	<TD>Edward's version of JsUnit is more based on a nice browser frontend.
	This would be also nice to have to my version. Edward and I agreed that I
	may try to integrate his GUI on top of my engine. Work in progress.</TD>
