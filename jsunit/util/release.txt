    <td>Update compatibility list</td>
    
    <td>Meanwhile I am aware of a lot more applications supporting JavaScript.
    Since most of the applications share the same JavaScript engine, I will
    introduce a grouping in the compatibility section of the documentation.
    Additionally I have to test the new JsUnit version for the supported
    platforms again and a compatibility check with the version 1.1 test cases
    should be done.</td>

    <td>Better usage of static methods</td>
    
    <td>JsUnit uses currently the prototype to simulate static methods.
    Meanwhile I learned, that there is a better way to model such
    functionality and I will refactor some code for next version 1.3 in
    accordance with an updated js2doxy.pl script.</td>
